# RSpec Timeout.

RSpec timeout stops you from having a test suite which takes too long to run by
killing the RSpec process if it takes longer than a certain amount of time to
complete running the test suite.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rspec_timeout'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rspec_timeout

## Usage

Open `spec_helper.rb` add a require for RSpec Timeout and set it up in your
specs:

```ruby
require "rspec_timeout"
RSpec.configure do |config|
  RSpecTimeout.setup(config)
end
```

This will cause your test suite to fail if it takes more than 120 seconds (the
default timeout) to execute.

If you'd like to customise the timeout, you can pass the `:timeout` option,
which specifies how many seconds your test suite stops executing after:

```ruby
require "rspec_timeout"
RSpec.configure do |config|
  # stop after 2 seconds
  RSpecTimeout.setup(config, :timeout => 2)
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
